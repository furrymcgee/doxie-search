Overview
~~~~~~~~

Doxygwin is a search engine for office documents and emails on Windows.
A officce system uses documentation in many different formats.
There are docx, pdf, email for example.
The Doxygwin search engine uses dwww to search documents in a web browser.

Doxygwin is based on dwww, doc-base and other debian packages ported to cygwin.

All installed on-line documentation will be served via a local HTTP
server at http://localhost/dwww/. This package runs cron scripts to
convert available resources to the HTML pages.  Executing the dwww
command starts a sensible WWW browser locally to access them.
