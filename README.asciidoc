DOXYGWIN
-----

Doxygwin is a search engine for your office documents and emails on
Windows. A typical system has documentation in many formats (docx, pdf, email,
...). The Doxygwin finds all of them in a web browser.

Doxygwin is based on dwww and other Debian packages ported to Cygwin:
"All installed on-line documentation will be served via a local HTTP
server at http://localhost/dwww/. This package runs cron scripts to
convert available resources to the HTML pages.  Executing the dwww
command starts a sensible WWW browser locally to access them."

REQUIREMENTS
------------

A Cygwin installation is used for building and installation.
The autorun.inf starts the installation. Please see
link below how to install required Cygwin packages with cygwin-auto-install.
There is a repository with all packages built for x86.

INSTALL
-------

Start cygwin-auto-installer/cygwin-install.bat with autorun.inf or manually.
Install dpkg and cygport to build packages from debian sources.
