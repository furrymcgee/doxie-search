DOXIE SEARCH
============

Doxie Search is a Cygwin port of the Debian dwww package.

DWWW 
====

A typical Linux system has documentation in many formats (manual pages,
info files, READMEs, and so on).  dwww makes it possible to access  all
of  these  via the same interface, a WWW browser.  This makes it easier
to use the documentation.

All installed on-line documentation will be served via a local HTTP
server at http://localhost/dwww/. This package runs cron scripts to
convert available resources to the HTML pages.  Executing the dwww
command starts a sensible WWW browser locally to access them.
