DOXIE
=====

Doxie Search is a search engine for your office documents and emails on
Windows. A typical system has documentation in many formats (docx, pdf, email,
...). The Doxie Search finds all of them in a web browser.

Doxie Search is based on dwww and other Debian packages ported to Cygwin:
"All installed on-line documentation will be served via a local HTTP
server at http://localhost/dwww/. This package runs cron scripts to
convert available resources to the HTML pages.  Executing the dwww
command starts a sensible WWW browser locally to access them."

REQUIREMENTS
============

A Cygwin installation is required for building and installation. Please see
